# Gesture-controlled-virtual-mouse
Gesture-Based Virtual Mouse enables humanâ€“computer interaction through hand gestures captured by a webcam. It provides smooth cursor control along with left/right/double click, scrolling, and drag-and-drop operations. This project offers an intuitive, touch-free, and accessible alternative to traditional mouse devices.
